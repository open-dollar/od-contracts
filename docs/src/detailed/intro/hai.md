# Introduction to HAI

## Introduction to HAI: A Framework for Stablecoin Systems

HAI serves as a framework for creating systems capable of issuing stablecoins. These stablecoins not only act as a reliable source of collateral for other DeFi protocols—when compared to assets like ETH or BTC—but also function as a store of value, complete with an integrated funding rate.

For a comprehensive understanding of the HAI framework, this documentation aims to detail each of its components. We strongly recommend reviewing Reflexer's original [whitepaper](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/whitepapers/blob/master/English/rai-english.pdf) as a precursor to this documentation.

#### Core Differentiators of HAI from GEB

HAI is an enhanced fork of [GEB](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb), but it comes with several key distinctions:

- **Advanced System Parameter Controls**: HAI features refined mechanisms for managing system parameters, offering superior flexibility and control.
- **Enhanced Deployment and Upgradeability**: The framework allows for streamlined deployment and upgrades, simplifying system maintenance.
- **Robust Testing and Simulation Suite**: HAI includes an upgraded testing and simulation environment, aiding in the identification and mitigation of system risks.
- **Emphasis on Multi-Collateral Operations**: HAI is designed with a focus on handling multiple types of collateral, broadening its application scope.
- **Inclusion of Factories for Common Contract Types**: The framework comes with pre-built factories for commonly used contract types, reducing the operations needed for collateral setup.
- **Standardized Methods and Contract Utilities**: HAI standardizes the way contracts and methods are utilized, making it easier for developers to generate changes across the system.
- **Revamped Contract Interactions**: The framework restructures the way contracts communicate with each other, leading to more efficient and reliable operations.

By incorporating these features, HAI aims to provide a more advanced, reliable, and user-friendly stablecoin system.
